# StateOfTheUnion - Music 256A - Assignment 4

The following is a piece created while election results were coming the evening of Nov. 8th.

Use the arrow keys to control the white dots on the screen, and use the 'x' and 'z' keys to increase and decrease positional noise respectively. Also, notice that the application window is shrinking. If you want to keep the application from collapsing in on itself entirely, you'll have to drag it out from the bottom right hand corner...

The drone noise was created in Faust (ambience.dsp), and the popping noise was sampled from the Mac OSX System Sounds bank.
